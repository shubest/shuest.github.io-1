I knew the Minecraft game when I'm a student, but hasn't tried it until this year, when I get so many Minecraft players in the Shou.TV project.

It's amazing, so I plan to create a large world for all those amazing players. This will be a big experiment, I don't have any experiences in gaming server development. And it will be interesting to see what would happen once lots of players crafting in a single world.

The current only Minecraft: PE server is PocketMine-MP, which is implemented in PHP, and it crashes too often and cannot handle many users. I plan to create a new server in the Go programming language, anybody interested in the project?
