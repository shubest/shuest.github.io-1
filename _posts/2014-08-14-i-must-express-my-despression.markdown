Today, I submitted [The Technology Behind Shou.TV](https://blog.shou.tv/the-technology-behind-shoutv) with title _Node.js and WebSocket video broadcasting architecture_ to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8176978), which is dead now. I screwed up.

I didn't use the original title because Shou.TV is not a famous service, I didn't intend to make it like an ad or something, and I wanted to expose the summary of the blog clearly.

Then I post the HN link to a local Node.js forum http://cnodejs.org (I have removed it) and a WeChat group. The Shou.TV twitter account also re-tweeted the [tweet from the HN bot](https://twitter.com/hnycombinator/status/499897879805587456).

Some of my friends may want to help, and posted some comments not following the HN community guidelines. But some comments are just spam, I don't even know where are they from, e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=123hai. I started to feel nervous, but not able to do anything.

Finally, the submission is marked dead. :( Really, I feel down and sorry.

I'm among those startup founders who try the best to make a good product, make every details perfect, respect the users in every decision. I'm a programmer who'd love to share the knowledge and techniques, do something important but useless. But we just don't know how to make a [pitch](http://www.aaronkharris.com/advice-on-pitching) or to market the product.

I feel good now, and sorry to the HN community.
